    Circuit attributes
    ==================

    :class:`QuantumCircuit` has a small number of public attributes, which are mostly older
    functionality.  Most of its functionality is accessed through methods.

    A small handful of the attributes are intentionally mutable, the rest are data attributes that
    should be considered immutable.

                                   This attribute is deprecated and :meth:`.estimate_duration`
                                   should be used instead.

    :attr:`layout`                 Hardware layout and routing information added by the transpiler.
    :attr:`num_ancillas`           The number of ancilla qubits in the circuit.

                                   transpiler passes.
    :attr:`parameters`             Ordered set-like view of the compile-time :class:`Parameter`\\ s

    :attr:`qubits`                 List of :class:`Qubit`\\ s tracked by the circuit.
    :attr:`unit`                   The unit of the :attr:`duration` field.
    ============================== =================================================================

    The core attribute is :attr:`data`.  This is a sequence-like object that exposes the
    :class:`CircuitInstruction`\\ s contained in an ordered form.  You generally should not mutate
    this object directly; :class:`QuantumCircuit` is only designed for append-only operations (which
    should use :meth:`append`).  Most operations that mutate circuits in place should be written as
    transpiler passes (:mod:`qiskit.transpiler`).

    .. autoattribute:: data

    Alongside the :attr:`data`, the :attr:`global_phase` of a circuit can have some impact on its
    output, if the circuit is used to describe a :class:`.Gate` that may be controlled.  This is
    measured in radians and is directly settable.

    .. autoattribute:: global_phase

    The :attr:`name` of a circuit becomes the name of the :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` or
    :class:`.Gate` resulting from :meth:`to_instruction` and :meth:`to_gate` calls, which can be
    handy for visualizations.

    .. autoattribute:: name

    You can attach arbitrary :attr:`metadata` to a circuit.  No part of core Qiskit will inspect
    this or change its behavior based on metadata, but it will be faithfully passed through the
    transpiler, so you can tag your circuits yourself.  When serializing a circuit with QPY (see
    :mod:`qiskit.qpy`), the metadata will be JSON-serialized and you may need to pass a custom
    serializer to handle non-JSON-compatible objects within it (see :func:`.qpy.dump` for more
    detail).  This field is ignored during export to OpenQASM 2 or 3.

    .. autoattribute:: metadata

    :class:`QuantumCircuit` exposes data attributes tracking its internal quantum and classical bits
    and registers.  These appear as Python :class:`list`\\ s, but you should treat them as
    immutable; changing them will *at best* have no effect, and more likely will simply corrupt
    the internal data of the :class:`QuantumCircuit`.

    .. autoattribute:: qregs
    .. autoattribute:: cregs
    .. autoattribute:: qubits
    .. autoattribute:: ancillas
    .. autoattribute:: clbits

    The :ref:`compile-time parameters <circuit-compile-time-parameters>` present in instructions on
    the circuit are available in :attr:`parameters`.  This has a canonical order (mostly lexical,
    except in the case of :class:`.ParameterVector`), which matches the order that parameters will
    be assigned when using the list forms of :meth:`assign_parameters`, but also supports
    :class:`set`-like constant-time membership testing.

    .. autoattribute:: parameters

    If you have transpiled your circuit, so you have a physical circuit, you can inspect the
    :attr:`layout` attribute for information stored by the transpiler about how the virtual qubits
    of the source circuit map to the hardware qubits of your physical circuit, both at the start and
    end of the circuit.

    .. autoattribute:: layout

    If your circuit was also *scheduled* as part of a transpilation, it will expose the individual
    timings of each instruction, along with the total :attr:`duration` of the circuit.

    .. autoattribute:: duration
    .. autoattribute:: unit
    .. autoattribute:: op_start_times

    Finally, :class:`QuantumCircuit` exposes several simple properties as dynamic read-only numeric
    attributes.

    .. autoattribute:: num_ancillas
    .. autoattribute:: num_clbits
    .. autoattribute:: num_captured_vars
    .. autoattribute:: num_captured_stretches
    .. autoattribute:: num_declared_vars
    .. autoattribute:: num_declared_stretches
    .. autoattribute:: num_input_vars
    .. autoattribute:: num_identifiers
    .. autoattribute:: num_parameters
    .. autoattribute:: num_qubits
    .. autoattribute:: num_stretches
    .. autoattribute:: num_vars

    Creating new circuits
    =====================

    =========================  =====================================================================
    Method                     Summary
    =========================  =====================================================================
    :meth:`__init__`           Default constructor of no-instruction circuits.
    :meth:`copy`               Make a complete copy of an existing circuit.
    :meth:`copy_empty_like`    Copy data objects from one circuit into a new one without any
                               instructions.
    :meth:`from_instructions`  Infer data objects needed from a list of instructions.
    :meth:`from_qasm_file`     Legacy interface to :func:`.qasm2.load`.
    :meth:`from_qasm_str`      Legacy interface to :func:`.qasm2.loads`.
    =========================  =====================================================================

    The default constructor (``QuantumCircuit(...)``) produces a circuit with no initial
    instructions. The arguments to the default constructor can be used to seed the circuit with
    quantum and classical data storage, and to provide a name, global phase and arbitrary metadata.
    All of these fields can be expanded later.

    .. automethod:: __init__

    If you have an existing circuit, you can produce a copy of it using :meth:`copy`, including all
    its instructions.  This is useful if you want to keep partial circuits while extending another,
    or to have a version you can mutate in-place while leaving the prior one intact.

    .. automethod:: copy

    Similarly, if you want a circuit that contains all the same data objects (bits, registers,
    variables, etc) but with none of the instructions, you can use :meth:`copy_empty_like`.  This is
    quite common when you want to build up a new layer of a circuit to then use apply onto the back
    with :meth:`compose`, or to do a full rewrite of a circuit's instructions.

    .. automethod:: copy_empty_like

    In some cases, it is most convenient to generate a list of :class:`.CircuitInstruction`\\ s
    separately to an entire circuit context, and then to build a circuit from this.  The
    :meth:`from_instructions` constructor will automatically capture all :class:`.Qubit` and
    :class:`.Clbit` instances used in the instructions, and create a new :class:`QuantumCircuit`
    object that has the correct resources and all the instructions.

    .. automethod:: from_instructions

    :class:`QuantumCircuit` also still has two constructor methods that are legacy wrappers around
    the importers in :mod:`qiskit.qasm2`.  These automatically apply :ref:`the legacy compatibility
    settings <qasm2-legacy-compatibility>` of :func:`~.qasm2.load` and :func:`~.qasm2.loads`.

    .. automethod:: from_qasm_file
    .. automethod:: from_qasm_str

    Data objects on circuits
    ========================

    .. _circuit-adding-data-objects:

    Adding data objects
    -------------------

    =============================  =================================================================
    Method                         Adds this kind of data
    =============================  =================================================================
    :meth:`add_bits`               :class:`.Qubit`\\ s and :class:`.Clbit`\\ s.
    :meth:`add_register`           :class:`.QuantumRegister` and :class:`.ClassicalRegister`.
    :meth:`add_var`                :class:`~.expr.Var` nodes with local scope and initializers.
    :meth:`add_stretch`            :class:`~.expr.Stretch` nodes with local scope.
    :meth:`add_input`              :class:`~.expr.Var` nodes that are treated as circuit inputs.
    :meth:`add_capture`            :class:`~.expr.Var` or :class:`~.expr.Stretch` nodes captured
                                   from containing scopes.
    :meth:`add_uninitialized_var`  :class:`~.expr.Var` nodes with local scope and undefined state.
    =============================  =================================================================

    Typically you add most of the data objects (:class:`.Qubit`, :class:`.Clbit`,
    :class:`.ClassicalRegister`, etc) to the circuit as part of using the :meth:`__init__` default
    constructor, or :meth:`copy_empty_like`.  However, it is also possible to add these afterwards.
    Typed classical data, such as standalone :class:`~.expr.Var` nodes (see
    :ref:`circuit-repr-real-time-classical`), can be both constructed and added with separate
    methods.

    New registerless :class:`.Qubit` and :class:`.Clbit` objects are added using :meth:`add_bits`.
    These objects must not already be present in the circuit.  You can check if a bit exists in the
    circuit already using :meth:`find_bit`.

    .. automethod:: add_bits

    Registers are added to the circuit with :meth:`add_register`.  In this method, it is not an
    error if some of the bits are already present in the circuit.  In this case, the register will
    be an "alias" over the bits.  This is not generally well-supported by hardware backends; it is
    probably best to stay away from relying on it.  The registers a given bit is in are part of the
    return of :meth:`find_bit`.

    .. automethod:: add_register

    :ref:`Real-time, typed classical data <circuit-repr-real-time-classical>` is represented on the
    circuit by :class:`~.expr.Var` nodes with a well-defined :class:`~.types.Type`.  It is possible
    to instantiate these separately to a circuit (see :meth:`.Var.new`), but it is often more
    convenient to use circuit methods that will automatically manage the types and expression
    initialization for you.  The two most common methods are :meth:`add_var` (locally scoped
    variables) and :meth:`add_input` (inputs to the circuit). Additionally, the method
    :meth:`add_stretch` can be used to add stretches to the circuit.

    .. automethod:: add_var
    .. automethod:: add_input
    .. automethod:: add_stretch

    In addition, there are two lower-level methods that can be useful for programmatic generation of
    circuits.  When working interactively, you will most likely not need these; most uses of
    :meth:`add_uninitialized_var` are part of :meth:`copy_empty_like`, and most uses of
    :meth:`add_capture` would be better off using :ref:`the control-flow builder interface
    <circuit-control-flow-methods>`.

    .. automethod:: add_uninitialized_var
    .. automethod:: add_capture

    Working with bits and registers
    -------------------------------

    A :class:`.Bit` instance is, on its own, just a unique handle for circuits to use in their own
    contexts.  If you have got a :class:`.Bit` instance and a circuit, just can find the contexts
    that the bit exists in using :meth:`find_bit`, such as its integer index in the circuit and any
    registers it is contained in.

    .. automethod:: find_bit

    Similarly, you can query a circuit to see if a register has already been added to it by using
    :meth:`has_register`.

    .. automethod:: has_register

    Working with compile-time parameters
    ------------------------------------

    .. seealso::
        :ref:`circuit-compile-time-parameters`
            A more complete discussion of what compile-time parametrization is, and how it fits into
            Qiskit's data model.

    Unlike bits, registers, and real-time typed classical data, compile-time symbolic parameters are
    not manually added to a circuit.  Their presence is inferred by being contained in operations
    added to circuits and the global phase.  An ordered list of all parameters currently in a
    circuit is at :attr:`QuantumCircuit.parameters`.

    The most common operation on :class:`.Parameter` instances is to replace them in symbolic
    operations with some numeric value, or another symbolic expression.  This is done with
    :meth:`assign_parameters`.

    .. automethod:: assign_parameters

    The circuit tracks parameters by :class:`.Parameter` instances themselves, and forbids having
    multiple parameters of the same name to avoid some problems when interoperating with OpenQASM or
    other external formats.  You can use :meth:`has_parameter` and :meth:`get_parameter` to query
    the circuit for a parameter with the given string name.

    .. automethod:: has_parameter
    .. automethod:: get_parameter

    .. _circuit-real-time-methods:

    Working with real-time typed classical data
    -------------------------------------------

    .. seealso::
        :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classical`
            Module-level documentation for how the variable-, expression- and type-systems work, the
            objects used to represent them, and the classical operations available.

        :ref:`circuit-repr-real-time-classical`
            A discussion of how real-time data fits into the entire :mod:`qiskit.circuit` data model
            as a whole.

        :ref:`circuit-adding-data-objects`
            The methods for adding new :class:`~.expr.Var` or :class:`~.expr.Stretch` identifiers
            to a circuit after initialization.

    You can retrieve identifiers attached to a circuit (e.g. a :class:`~.expr.Var` or
    :class:`~.expr.Stretch`) by name with methods :meth:`get_var`, :meth:`get_stretch`, or
    :meth:`get_identifier`. You can also check if a circuit
    contains a given identifier with :meth:`has_var`, :meth:`has_stretch`, or
    :meth:`has_identifier`.

    .. automethod:: get_var
    .. automethod:: get_stretch
    .. automethod:: get_identifier
    .. automethod:: has_var
    .. automethod:: has_stretch
    .. automethod:: has_identifier


    There are also several iterator methods that you can use to get the full set of identifiers
    tracked by a circuit.  At least one of :meth:`iter_input_vars` and :meth:`iter_captured_vars`
    will be empty, as inputs and captures are mutually exclusive.  All of the iterators have
    corresponding dynamic properties on :class:`QuantumCircuit` that contain their length:
    :attr:`num_vars`, :attr:`num_stretches`, :attr:`num_input_vars`, :attr:`num_captured_vars`,
    :attr:`num_captured_stretches`, :attr:`num_declared_vars`, or :attr:`num_declared_stretches`.

    .. automethod:: iter_vars
    .. automethod:: iter_stretches
    .. automethod:: iter_input_vars
    .. automethod:: iter_captured_vars
    .. automethod:: iter_captured_stretches
    .. automethod:: iter_declared_vars
    .. automethod:: iter_declared_stretches


    .. _circuit-adding-operations:

    Adding operations to circuits
    =============================

    You can add anything that implements the :class:`.Operation` interface to a circuit as a single
    instruction, though most things you will want to add will be :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` or
    :class:`~.circuit.Gate` instances.

    .. seealso::
        :ref:`circuit-operations-instructions`
            The :mod:`qiskit.circuit`-level documentation on the different interfaces that Qiskit
            uses to define circuit-level instructions.

    .. _circuit-append-compose:

    Methods to add general operations
    ---------------------------------

    These are the base methods that handle adding any object, including user-defined ones, onto
    circuits.

    ===============  ===============================================================================
    Method           When to use it
    ===============  ===============================================================================
    :meth:`append`   Add an instruction as a single object onto a circuit.
    :meth:`_append`  Same as :meth:`append`, but a low-level interface that elides almost all error
                     checking.
    :meth:`compose`  Inline the instructions from one circuit onto another.
    :meth:`tensor`   Like :meth:`compose`, but strictly for joining circuits that act on disjoint
                     qubits.
    ===============  ===============================================================================

    :class:`QuantumCircuit` has two main ways that you will add more operations onto a circuit.
    Which to use depends on whether you want to add your object as a single "instruction"
    (:meth:`append`), or whether you want to join the instructions from two circuits together
    (:meth:`compose`).

    A single instruction or operation appears as a single entry in the :attr:`data` of the circuit,
    and as a single box when drawn in the circuit visualizers (see :meth:`draw`).  A single
    instruction is the "unit" that a hardware backend might be defined in terms of (see
    :class:`.Target`).  An :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` can come with a
    :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.definition`, which is one rule the transpiler (see
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler`) will be able to fall back on to decompose it for hardware, if needed.
    An :class:`.Operation` that is not also an :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` can
    only be decomposed if it has some associated high-level synthesis method registered for it (see
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin`).

    A :class:`QuantumCircuit` alone is not a single :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`; it is rather
    more complicated, since it can, in general, represent a complete program with typed classical
    memory inputs and outputs, and control flow.  Qiskit's (and most hardware's) data model does not
    yet have the concept of re-usable callable subroutines with virtual quantum operands.  You can
    convert simple circuits that act only on qubits with unitary operations into a :class:`.Gate`
    using :meth:`to_gate`, and simple circuits acting only on qubits and clbits into a
    :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` with :meth:`to_instruction`.

    When you have an :class:`.Operation`, :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`, or :class:`.Gate`, add it
    to the circuit, specifying the qubit and clbit arguments with :meth:`append`.

    .. automethod:: append

    :meth:`append` does quite substantial error checking to ensure that you cannot accidentally
    break the data model of :class:`QuantumCircuit`.  If you are programmatically generating a
    circuit from known-good data, you can elide much of this error checking by using the fast-path
    appender :meth:`_append`, but at the risk that the caller is responsible for ensuring they are
    passing only valid data.

    .. automethod:: _append

    In other cases, you may want to join two circuits together, applying the instructions from one
    circuit onto specified qubits and clbits on another circuit.  This "inlining" operation is
    called :meth:`compose` in Qiskit.  :meth:`compose` is, in general, more powerful than
    a :meth:`to_instruction`-plus-:meth:`append` combination for joining two circuits, because it
    can also link typed classical data together, and allows for circuit control-flow operations to
    be joined onto another circuit.

    The downsides to :meth:`compose` are that it is a more complex operation that can involve more
    rewriting of the operand, and that it necessarily must move data from one circuit object to
    another.  If you are building up a circuit for yourself and raw performance is a core goal,
    consider passing around your base circuit and having different parts of your algorithm write
    directly to the base circuit, rather than building a temporary layer circuit.

    .. automethod:: compose

    If you are trying to join two circuits that will apply to completely disjoint qubits and clbits,
    :meth:`tensor` is a convenient wrapper around manually adding bit objects and calling
    :meth:`compose`.

    .. automethod:: tensor

    As some rules of thumb:

    * If you have a single :class:`.Operation`, :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` or :class:`.Gate`,
      you should definitely use :meth:`append` or :meth:`_append`.
    * If you have a :class:`QuantumCircuit` that represents a single atomic instruction for a larger
      circuit that you want to re-use, you probably want to call :meth:`to_instruction` or
      :meth:`to_gate`, and then apply the result of that to the circuit using :meth:`append`.
    * If you have a :class:`QuantumCircuit` that represents a larger "layer" of another circuit, or
      contains typed classical variables or control flow, you should use :meth:`compose` to merge it
      onto another circuit.
    * :meth:`tensor` is wanted far more rarely than either :meth:`append` or :meth:`compose`.
      Internally, it is mostly a wrapper around :meth:`add_bits` and :meth:`compose`.

    Some potential pitfalls to beware of:

    * Even if you re-use a custom :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` during circuit construction, the
      transpiler will generally have to "unroll" each invocation of it to its inner decomposition
      before beginning work on it.  This should not prevent you from using the
      :meth:`to_instruction`-plus-:meth:`append` pattern, as the transpiler will improve in this
      regard over time.
    * :meth:`compose` will, by default, produce a new circuit for backwards compatibility.  This is
      more expensive, and not usually what you want, so you should set ``inplace=True``.
    * Both :meth:`append` and :meth:`compose` (but not :meth:`_append`) have a ``copy`` keyword
      argument that defaults to ``True``.  In these cases, the incoming :class:`.Operation`
      instances will be copied if Qiskit detects that the objects have mutability about them (such
      as taking gate parameters).  If you are sure that you will not re-use the objects again in
      other places, you should set ``copy=False`` to prevent this copying, which can be a
      substantial speed-up for large objects.

    Methods to add standard instructions
    ------------------------------------

    The :class:`QuantumCircuit` class has helper methods to add many of the Qiskit standard-library
    instructions and gates onto a circuit.  These are generally equivalent to manually constructing
    an instance of the relevent :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` object, then passing that to
    :meth:`append` with the remaining arguments placed into the ``qargs`` and ``cargs`` fields as
    appropriate.

    The following methods apply special non-unitary :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` operations to the
    circuit:

    Adding control flow to circuits
    -------------------------------

    .. seealso::
        :ref:`circuit-control-flow-repr`

        Discussion of how control-flow operations are represented in the whole :mod:`qiskit.circuit`
        context.

    ==============================  ================================================================
    :class:`QuantumCircuit` method  Control-flow instruction

    :meth:`if_test`                 :class:`.IfElseOp` with only a ``True`` body
    :meth:`if_else`                 :class:`.IfElseOp` with both ``True`` and ``False`` bodies

    :meth:`continue_loop`           :class:`.ContinueLoopOp`
    ==============================  ================================================================

    :class:`QuantumCircuit` has corresponding methods for all of the control-flow operations that
    are supported by Qiskit.  These have two forms for calling them.  The first is a very
    straightfowards convenience wrapper that takes in the block bodies of the instructions as
    :class:`QuantumCircuit` arguments, and simply constructs and appends the corresponding
    :class:`.ControlFlowOp`.

    The second form, which we strongly recommend you use for constructing control flow, is called
    *the builder interface*.  Here, the methods take only the real-time discriminant of the
    operation, and return `context managers
    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager>`__ that you enter using
    ``with``.  You can then use regular :class:`QuantumCircuit` methods within those blocks to build
    up the control-flow bodies, and Qiskit will automatically track which of the data resources are
    needed for the inner blocks, building the complete :class:`.ControlFlowOp` as you leave the
    ``with`` statement.  It is far simpler and less error-prone to build control flow
    programmatically this way.

    When using the control-flow builder interface, you may sometimes want a qubit to be included in
    a block, even though it has no operations defined.  In this case, you can use the :meth:`noop`
    method.

    To check whether a circuit contains a :class:`.ControlFlowOp` you can use the helper method
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.has_control_flow_op`.

    ..
        TODO: expand the examples of the builder interface.

    .. automethod:: break_loop
    .. automethod:: continue_loop
    .. automethod:: for_loop

    .. automethod:: if_test
    .. automethod:: switch
    .. automethod:: while_loop
    .. automethod:: noop
    .. automethod:: has_control_flow_op


    Converting circuits to single objects
    -------------------------------------

    As discussed in :ref:`circuit-append-compose`, you can convert a circuit to either an
    :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` or a :class:`.Gate` using two helper methods.

    .. automethod:: to_instruction
    .. automethod:: to_gate


    Helper mutation methods
    -----------------------

    There are two higher-level methods on :class:`QuantumCircuit` for appending measurements to the
    end of a circuit.  Note that by default, these also add an extra register.

    .. automethod:: measure_active
    .. automethod:: measure_all

    There are two "subtractive" methods on :class:`QuantumCircuit` as well.  This is not a use-case
    that :class:`QuantumCircuit` is designed for; typically you should just look to use
    :meth:`copy_empty_like` in place of :meth:`clear`, and run :meth:`remove_final_measurements` as
    its transpiler-pass form :class:`.RemoveFinalMeasurements`.

    .. automethod:: clear
    .. automethod:: remove_final_measurements


    Circuit properties
    ==================

    Simple circuit metrics
    ----------------------

    When constructing quantum circuits, there are several properties that help quantify
    the "size" of the circuits, and their ability to be run on a noisy quantum device.
    Some of these, like number of qubits, are straightforward to understand, while others
    like depth and number of tensor components require a bit more explanation.  Here we will
    explain all of these properties, and, in preparation for understanding how circuits change
    when run on actual devices, highlight the conditions under which they change.

    Consider the following circuit:

    .. plot::
       :alt: Circuit diagram output by the previous code.
       :include-source:

       from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
       qc = QuantumCircuit(12)
       for idx in range(5):
          qc.h(idx)
          qc.cx(idx, idx+5)

       qc.cx(1, 7)
       qc.x(8)
       qc.cx(1, 9)
       qc.x(7)
       qc.cx(1, 11)
       qc.swap(6, 11)
       qc.swap(6, 9)
       qc.swap(6, 10)
       qc.x(6)
       qc.draw('mpl')

    From the plot, it is easy to see that this circuit has 12 qubits, and a collection of
    Hadamard, CNOT, X, and SWAP gates.  But how to quantify this programmatically? Because we
    can do single-qubit gates on all the qubits simultaneously, the number of qubits in this
    circuit is equal to the :meth:`width` of the circuit::

       assert qc.width() == 12

    We can also just get the number of qubits directly using :attr:`num_qubits`::

       assert qc.num_qubits == 12

    .. important::

       For a quantum circuit composed from just qubits, the circuit width is equal
       to the number of qubits. This is the definition used in quantum computing. However,
       for more complicated circuits with classical registers, and classically controlled gates,
       this equivalence breaks down. As such, from now on we will not refer to the number of
       qubits in a quantum circuit as the width.

    It is also straightforward to get the number and type of the gates in a circuit using
    :meth:`count_ops`::

       qc.count_ops()

    .. code-block:: text

       OrderedDict([('cx', 8), ('h', 5), ('x', 3), ('swap', 3)])

    We can also get just the raw count of operations by computing the circuits
    :meth:`size`::

       assert qc.size() == 19

    .. automethod:: count_ops
    .. automethod:: depth
    .. automethod:: get_instructions
    .. automethod:: num_connected_components
    .. automethod:: num_nonlocal_gates
    .. automethod:: num_tensor_factors
    .. automethod:: num_unitary_factors
    .. automethod:: size
    .. automethod:: width

    Accessing scheduling information
    --------------------------------

    If a :class:`QuantumCircuit` has been scheduled as part of a transpilation pipeline, the timing
    information for individual qubits can be accessed.  The whole-circuit timing information is
    available through the :meth:`estimate_duration` method and :attr:`op_start_times` attribute.

    .. automethod:: estimate_duration
    .. automethod:: qubit_duration
    .. automethod:: qubit_start_time
    .. automethod:: qubit_stop_time

    Instruction-like methods
    ========================

    ..
        These methods really shouldn't be on `QuantumCircuit` at all.  They're generally more
        appropriate as `Instruction` or `Gate` methods.  `reverse_ops` shouldn't be a method _full
        stop_---it was copying a `DAGCircuit` method from an implementation detail of the original
        `SabreLayout` pass in Qiskit.

    :class:`QuantumCircuit` also contains a small number of methods that are very
    :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`-like in detail.  You may well find better integration and more
    API support if you first convert your circuit to an :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`
    (:meth:`to_instruction`) or :class:`.Gate` (:meth:`to_gate`) as appropriate, then call the
    corresponding method.

    .. automethod:: control
    .. automethod:: inverse
    .. automethod:: power
    .. automethod:: repeat
    .. automethod:: reverse_ops

    Visualization
    =============

    Qiskit includes some drawing tools to give you a quick feel for what your circuit looks like.
    This tooling is primarily targeted at producing either a `Matplotlib
    <https://matplotlib.org/>`__- or text-based drawing.  There is also a lesser-featured LaTeX
    backend for drawing, but this is only for simple circuits, and is not as actively maintained.

    .. seealso::
        :mod:`qiskit.visualization`
            The primary documentation for all of Qiskit's visualization tooling.

    .. automethod:: draw

    In addition to the core :meth:`draw` driver, there are two visualization-related helper methods,

            `QuantumCirucit` documents its `__init__` method explicitly, unlike most classes where
            it's implicitly appended to the class-level documentation, just because the class is so
            huge and has a lot of introductory material to its class docstring.

        Args:
            regs: The registers to be included in the circuit.

                * If a list of :class:`~.Register` objects, represents the :class:`.QuantumRegister`
                  and/or :class:`.ClassicalRegister` objects to include in the circuit.

                  For example:

                    * ``QuantumCircuit(QuantumRegister(4))``
                    * ``QuantumCircuit(QuantumRegister(4), ClassicalRegister(3))``
                    * ``QuantumCircuit(QuantumRegister(4, 'qr0'), QuantumRegister(2, 'qr1'))``

                * If a list of ``int``, the amount of qubits and/or classical bits to include in
                  the circuit. It can either be a single int for just the number of quantum bits,
                  or 2 ints for the number of quantum bits and classical bits, respectively.

                  For example:

                    * ``QuantumCircuit(4) # A QuantumCircuit with 4 qubits``
                    * ``QuantumCircuit(4, 3) # A QuantumCircuit with 4 qubits and 3 classical bits``

                * If a list of python lists containing :class:`.Bit` objects, a collection of
                  :class:`.Bit` s to be added to the circuit.

            name: the name of the quantum circuit. If not set, an automatically generated string
                will be assigned.
            global_phase: The global phase of the circuit in radians.
            metadata: Arbitrary key value metadata to associate with the circuit. This gets
                stored as free-form data in a dict in the
                :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.metadata` attribute. It will not be directly
                used in the circuit.
            inputs: any variables to declare as ``input`` runtime variables for this circuit.  These
                should already be existing :class:`.expr.Var` nodes that you build from somewhere
                else; if you need to create the inputs as well, use
                :meth:`QuantumCircuit.add_input`.  The variables given in this argument will be
                passed directly to :meth:`add_input`.  A circuit cannot have both ``inputs`` and
                ``captures``.
            captures: any variables that this circuit scope should capture from a containing
                scope.  The variables given here will be passed directly to :meth:`add_capture`.  A
                circuit cannot have both ``inputs`` and ``captures``.
            declarations: any variables that this circuit should declare and initialize immediately.
                You can order this input so that later declarations depend on earlier ones
                (including inputs or captures). If you need to depend on values that will be
                computed later at runtime, use :meth:`add_var` at an appropriate point in the
                circuit execution.

                This argument is intended for convenient circuit initialization when you already
                have a set of created variables.  The variables used here will be directly passed to
                :meth:`add_var`, which you can use directly if this is the first time you are
                creating the variable.

        .. note::

            By default, this creates a new circuit object, leaving ``self`` untouched.  For most
            uses of this function, it is far more efficient to set ``inplace=True`` and modify the
            base circuit in-place.

        When dealing with realtime variables (:class:`.expr.Var` and :class:`.expr.Stretch` instances),
        there are two principal strategies for using :meth:`compose`:

        1. The ``other`` circuit is treated as entirely additive, including its variables.  The
           variables in ``other`` must be entirely distinct from those in ``self`` (use
           ``var_remap`` to help with this), and all variables in ``other`` will be declared anew in
           the output with matching input/capture/local scoping to how they are in ``other``.  This
           is generally what you want if you're joining two unrelated circuits.

        2. The ``other`` circuit was created as an exact extension to ``self`` to be inlined onto
           it, including acting on the existing variables in their states at the end of ``self``.
           In this case, ``other`` should be created with all these variables to be inlined declared
           as "captures", and then you can use ``inline_captures=True`` in this method to link them.
           This is generally what you want if you're building up a circuit by defining layers
           on-the-fly, or rebuilding a circuit using layers taken from itself.  You might find the
           ``vars_mode="captures"`` argument to :meth:`copy_empty_like` useful to create each
           layer's base, in this case.

        Args:
            other (qiskit.circuit.Instruction or QuantumCircuit):
                (sub)circuit or instruction to compose onto self.  If not a :obj:`.QuantumCircuit`,
                this can be anything that :obj:`.append` will accept.
            qubits (list[Qubit|int]): qubits of self to compose onto.
            clbits (list[Clbit|int]): clbits of self to compose onto.
            front (bool): If ``True``, front composition will be performed.  This is not possible within
                control-flow builder context managers.
            inplace (bool): If ``True``, modify the object. Otherwise, return composed circuit.
            copy (bool): If ``True`` (the default), then the input is treated as shared, and any
                contained instructions will be copied, if they might need to be mutated in the
                future.  You can set this to ``False`` if the input should be considered owned by
                the base circuit, in order to avoid unnecessary copies; in this case, it is not
                valid to use ``other`` afterward, and some instructions may have been mutated in
                place.
            var_remap (Mapping): mapping to use to rewrite :class:`.expr.Var` and
                :class:`.expr.Stretch` nodes in ``other`` as they are inlined into ``self``.
                This can be used to avoid naming conflicts.

                Both keys and values can be given as strings or direct identifier instances.
                If a key is a string, it matches any :class:`~.expr.Var` or :class:`~.expr.Stretch`
                with the same name.  If a value is a string, whenever a new key matches it, a new
                :class:`~.expr.Var` or :class:`~.expr.Stretch` is created with the correct type.
                If a value is a :class:`~.expr.Var`, its :class:`~.expr.Expr.type` must exactly
                match that of the variable it is replacing.
            inline_captures (bool): if ``True``, then all "captured" identifier nodes in
                the ``other`` :class:`.QuantumCircuit` are assumed to refer to identifiers already
                declared in ``self`` (as any input/capture/local type), and the uses in ``other``
                will apply to the existing identifiers.  If you want to build up a layer for an
                existing circuit to use with :meth:`compose`, you might find the
                ``vars_mode="captures"`` argument to :meth:`copy_empty_like` useful.  Any remapping
                in ``vars_remap`` occurs before evaluating this variable inlining.

                If this is ``False`` (the default), then all identifiers in ``other`` will be required
                to be distinct from those in ``self``, and new declarations will be made for them.
            wrap (bool): If True, wraps the other circuit into a gate (or instruction, depending on
                whether it contains only unitary instructions) before composing it onto self.
                Rather than using this option, it is almost always better to manually control this
                yourself by using :meth:`to_instruction` or :meth:`to_gate`, and then call
                :meth:`append`.

        Returns:
            QuantumCircuit: the composed circuit (returns None if inplace==True).

        Raises:
            CircuitError: if no correct wire mapping can be made between the two circuits, such as
                if ``other`` is wider than ``self``.
            CircuitError: if trying to emit a new circuit while ``self`` has a partially built
                control-flow context active, such as the context-manager forms of :meth:`if_test`,
                :meth:`for_loop` and :meth:`while_loop`.
            CircuitError: if trying to compose to the front of a circuit when a control-flow builder
                block is active; there is no clear meaning to this action.

        Examples:
            .. code-block:: python

                >>> lhs.compose(rhs, qubits=[3, 2], inplace=True)

                adding it to the circuit if it contains symbolic parameters, so it can be safely
                mutated without affecting other circuits the same instruction might be in.  If you

        **latex_source**: raw uncompiled latex output.

            Support for :class:`~.expr.Expr` nodes in conditions and :attr:`.SwitchCaseOp.target`
            fields is preliminary and incomplete.  The ``text`` and ``mpl`` drawers will make a
            best-effort attempt to show data dependencies, but the LaTeX-based drawers will skip
            these completely.

        Args:
            output: Select the output method to use for drawing the circuit.
                Valid choices are ``text``, ``mpl``, ``latex``, ``latex_source``.
                By default, the ``text`` drawer is used unless the user config file
                (usually ``~/.qiskit/settings.conf``) has an alternative backend set
                as the default. For example, ``circuit_drawer = latex``. If the output
                kwarg is set, that backend will always be used over the default in
                the user config file.
            scale: Scale of image to draw (shrink if ``< 1.0``). Only used by
                the ``mpl``, ``latex`` and ``latex_source`` outputs. Defaults to ``1.0``.
            filename: File path to save image to. Defaults to ``None`` (result not saved in a file).
            style: Style name, file name of style JSON file, or a dictionary specifying the style.

                * The supported style names are ``"iqp"`` (default), ``"iqp-dark"``, ``"clifford"``,
                  ``"textbook"`` and ``"bw"``.
                * If given a JSON file, e.g. ``my_style.json`` or ``my_style`` (the ``.json``
                  extension may be omitted), this function attempts to load the style dictionary
                  from that location. Note, that the JSON file must completely specify the
                  visualization specifications. The file is searched for in
                  ``qiskit/visualization/circuit/styles``, the current working directory, and
                  the location specified in ``~/.qiskit/settings.conf``.
                * If a dictionary, every entry overrides the default configuration. If the
                  ``"name"`` key is given, the default configuration is given by that style.
                  For example, ``{"name": "textbook", "subfontsize": 5}`` loads the ``"texbook"``
                  style and sets the subfontsize (e.g. the gate angles) to ``5``.
                * If ``None`` the default style ``"iqp"`` is used or, if given, the default style
                  specified in ``~/.qiskit/settings.conf``.

            interactive: When set to ``True``, show the circuit in a new window
                (for ``mpl`` this depends on the matplotlib backend being used
                supporting this). Note when used with either the `text` or the
                ``latex_source`` output type this has no effect and will be silently
                ignored. Defaults to ``False``.
            reverse_bits: When set to ``True``, reverse the bit order inside
                registers for the output visualization. Defaults to ``False`` unless the
                user config file (usually ``~/.qiskit/settings.conf``) has an
                alternative value set. For example, ``circuit_reverse_bits = True``.
            plot_barriers: Enable/disable drawing barriers in the output
                circuit. Defaults to ``True``.
            justify: Options are ``"left"``, ``"right"`` or ``"none"`` (str).
                If anything else is supplied, left justified will be used instead.
                It refers to where gates should be placed in the output circuit if
                there is an option. ``none`` results in each gate being placed in
                its own column. Defaults to ``left``.
            vertical_compression: ``high``, ``medium`` or ``low``. It
                merges the lines generated by the `text` output so the drawing
                will take less vertical room.  Default is ``medium``. Only used by
                the ``text`` output, will be silently ignored otherwise.
            idle_wires: Include (or not) idle wires (wires with no circuit elements)
                in output visualization. The string ``"auto"`` is also possible, in which
                case idle wires are show except that the circuit has a layout attached.
                Default is ``"auto"`` unless the
                user config file (usually ``~/.qiskit/settings.conf``) has an
                alternative value set. For example, ``circuit_idle_wires = False``.
            with_layout: Include layout information, with labels on the
                physical layout. Default is ``True``.
            fold: Sets pagination. It can be disabled using -1. In ``text``,
                sets the length of the lines. This is useful when the drawing does
                not fit in the console. If None (default), it will try to guess the
                console width using ``shutil.get_terminal_size()``. However, if
                running in jupyter, the default line length is set to 80 characters.
                In ``mpl``, it is the number of (visual) layers before folding.
                Default is 25.
            ax: Only used by the `mpl` backend. An optional ``matplotlib.axes.Axes``
                object to be used for the visualization output. If none is
                specified, a new matplotlib Figure will be created and used.
                Additionally, if specified there will be no returned Figure since
                it is redundant.
            initial_state: Adds :math:`|0\rangle` in the beginning of the qubit wires and
                :math:`0` to classical wires. Default is ``False``.
            cregbundle: If set to ``True``, bundle classical registers.
                Default is ``True``, except for when ``output`` is set to  ``"text"``.
            wire_order: A list of integers used to reorder the display
                of the bits. The list must have an entry for every bit with the bits
                in the range 0 to (``num_qubits`` + ``num_clbits``).
            expr_len: The number of characters to display if an :class:`~.expr.Expr`
                is used for the condition in a :class:`.ControlFlowOp`. If this number is exceeded,
                the string will be truncated at that number and '...' added to the end.

        Returns:
            :class:`.TextDrawing` or :class:`matplotlib.figure` or :class:`PIL.Image` or
            :class:`str`:

            * ``TextDrawing`` (if ``output='text'``)
                A drawing that can be printed as ascii art.
            * ``matplotlib.figure.Figure`` (if ``output='mpl'``)
                A matplotlib figure object for the circuit diagram.
            * ``PIL.Image`` (if ``output='latex``')
                An in-memory representation of the image of the circuit diagram.
            * ``str`` (if ``output='latex_source'``)
                The LaTeX source code for visualizing the circuit diagram.

        Raises:

        """Create a ``box`` of operations on this circuit that are treated atomically in the greater
        context.

        A "box" is a control-flow construct that is entered unconditionally.  The contents of the
        box behave somewhat as if the start and end of the box were barriers (see :meth:`barrier`),
        except it is permissible to commute operations "all the way" through the box.  The box is
        also an explicit scope for the purposes of variables, stretches and compiler passes.

        There are two forms for calling this function:

        * Pass a :class:`QuantumCircuit` positionally, and the ``qubits`` and ``clbits`` it acts
          on.  In this form, a :class:`.BoxOp` is immediately created and appended using the circuit
          as the body.

        * Use in a ``with`` statement with no ``body``, ``qubits`` or ``clbits``.  This is the
          "builder-interface form", where you then use other :class:`QuantumCircuit` methods within
          the Python ``with`` scope to add instructions to the ``box``.  This is the preferred form,
          and much less error prone.

        Examples:

            Using the builder interface to add two boxes in sequence.  The two boxes in this circuit
            can execute concurrently, and the second explicitly inserts a data-flow dependency on
            qubit 8 for the duration of the box, even though the qubit is idle.

            .. code-block:: python

                from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, Annotation

                class MyAnnotation(Annotation):
                    namespace = "my.namespace"

                qc = QuantumCircuit(9)
                with qc.box():
                    qc.cz(0, 1)

                    qc.cz(6, 7)
                    qc.noop(8)

            Using the explicit construction of box.  This creates the same circuit as above, and
            should give an indication why the previous form is preferred for interactive use.
